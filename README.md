# ui-vue-core

*This project is archived / readonly and was migrated to the [ui-dapps](https://github.com/evannetwork/ui-dapps) project.*

This library includes the core libraries for the evan.network ui development using vue js. Within the dapps folder, you will find the `evancore.vue.libs` dapp, that includes evan specific vue implementations and is published under `@evan.network/ui-vue-core`.

All other dapps are constructed simply, to exclude the wanted library and map the correct original package name. E.g.: The vue-material library is published using the ens address `material.vue.libs.evan`. Within the DBCP of the using DApp, this lib is referenced within the dbcp.json as dependency. Within the application it self, `vue-material` can be imported normally using `import VueMaterial from 'vue-material'`. Within the webpack configuration, the vue-material import can be exported, to reduce the bundle size. 

Available libraries:

| original          | ens address             |
|:------------------|:------------------------|
| axios             | axios.vue.libs.evan     |
| evancore.vue.libs | evancore.vue.libs.evan  |
| vuex-i18n         | i18n.vuex.libs.evan     |
| vue2-leaflet      | leaflet.vue.libs.evan   |
| vue-moment        | moment.vue.libs.evan    |
| vue-recaptcha     | recaptcha.vue.libs.evan |
| vue-router        | router.vue.libs.evan    |
| vue               | vue.libs.evan           |
| vuex              | vuex.libs.evan          |

## Install
- use `yarn install` or `npm install`

## UI Development
- build and serve the local dapp serve
- starts an local server at http://localhost:3000/dev.html
```bash
npm run serve
```

- build all dapps
```bash
npm run dapps-build
```

- serve for file change tracking
```bash
npm run dapps-serve
```

- VueJS is optimized using the a production build, that is not only build by minification. Append the `--prod` configuration to achive this: `npm run dapps-build --prod` or `npm run dapps-serve --prod`.
